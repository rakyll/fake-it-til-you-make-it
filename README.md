# fake-it-til-you-make-it

Have you come across to someone that thinks you don't deserve
a job because you don't have GitHub contributions?

Run this program.

## Usage


For example, commit 10 commits max every day for two years,
and avoid committing on Saturday and Sunday, with the random commit message:

```
go run main.go -max=10 -skip-weekend=true -rand-msg
```
## Why?

I obviously built this tool as a joke and don't encourage anyone
to use it. It's a demonstration that GitHub contributions can be faked,
and they are not a measure.
Please leave developers alone and let them focus on important problems
instead of wasting time gaming the system.
